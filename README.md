## General info
Using D3 a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements was developed to explore the relation between different variables.

## Data
The data set is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). It includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Technologies
* Tech 1 – D3
* Tech 2 - html
* Tech 3 - Javascript

## Setup
You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Status
Project is: _finished_, _subject to further improvement_ 

## Inspiration
Project based on the Trilogy Data Visualization Boot Camp
